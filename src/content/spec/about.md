Hi, I'm Wal - a network engineer at heart with over two decades of experience designing, building, and testing network systems. These days, i find myself standing at the crossroads of networking, automation, and AI.

This blog, Packets & Prompts, is where i share that journey - from applying software based to the traditional, to experimenting with natural language interface for network control and testing.

I’ve come to appreciate the elegance of simple yet highly effective solutions — the kind that cuts through complexity without compromising capability. To me, good engineering is about building with clear intent, keeping things lean, and making sure you’re solving the right problem in the right way.
