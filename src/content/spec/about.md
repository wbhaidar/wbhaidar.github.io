Hi, I'm Wal - a network engineer at heart with over two decades of experience designing, building, and testing network systems. These days, i find myself standing at the intersection of networking, automation, and AI.

**Packets & Prompts** is my attempt to give back to the community that's given me so much - the lessons, the tools, and the connections that have helped shaped my career.

This blog will cover everything from applying software-based approaches to network engineering, to experimenting with natural language interfaces across network systems.

Iâ€™ve come to appreciate the elegance of simple yet highly effective solutions. Whether i am working on a design, an algorithm or a maths problem i'm tackling with my kids, i start by visualising the end goal, then breaking it down into manageable pieces. That clarity comes from years of doing, getting things wrong, and staying curious enough to keep asking why.
