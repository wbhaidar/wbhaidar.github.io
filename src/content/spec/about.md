# About
Hi, I'm Wal - a network engineer at hear with over two decades of experience desging, building, and testing complex network systems. These days, i find myself standing at the crossroads of networking, automation, and AI.

This blog, Packets & Prompts, is where i share that journey - from applying software based to the traditiona, to experimenting with natural language interface for network control and testing.

I revel in the elegance of simple yet highly effective solutions to problem spaces. To me, good engineering is about clarity, effiency and purpose.
