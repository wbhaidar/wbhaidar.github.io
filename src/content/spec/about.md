Hi, I'm Wal - a network engineer at heart with over two decades of experience designing, building, and testing network systems. These days, i find myself standing at the crossroads of networking, automation, and AI.

This blog, Packets & Prompts, is where i share that journey - from applying software based to the traditiona, to experimenting with natural language interface for network control and testing.

I've come to appreciate the elegance of simple yet highly effective solutions to problem spaces - the kind that cuts through complexity, without comprimising capability. To me, good engineering is about knowing why you're building something, keeping it lean, and making sure it actually solves the right problem.
